# CS Quiz Generator

This is the front end of a full-stack CS quiz generator application, which intends to help people refresh their CS knowledge.  
The current version does not use BootStrap.  
We'll use BootStrap to beautify the UI for the next version.

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Or open [https://cs-quiz-generator.netlify.app](https://cs-quiz-generator.netlify.app) to view without run the application locally.
