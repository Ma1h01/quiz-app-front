# CS Quiz Generator

This is the front end of a full-stack CS quiz generator application, which intends to help people refresh their CS knowledge.  
The current version does not use BootStrap.  
We'll use BootStrap to beautify the UI for the next version.

## How to run
1. Follow the steps described in my [quiz-app-back repo](https://github.com/Ma1h01/quiz-app-back.git) to turn on the server and database
2. Open [https://cs-quiz-generator.netlify.app](https://cs-quiz-generator.netlify.app) to interact with the UI
